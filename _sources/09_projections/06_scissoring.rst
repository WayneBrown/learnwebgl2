9.6 - Scissoring
::::::::::::::::

Built into the graphics pipeline is functionality called *scissoring*.
Scissoring allows you to restrict which pixels in the *render buffer* the
pipeline can modify. When you restrict
rendering to a sub-area of the *render buffer*, the entire rendering is
mapped into this sub-area. This allows you to create multiple renderings
in a single canvas.

The *scissoring* operation is not enabled unless you call :code:`gl.enable()`
with the :code:`gl.SCISSOR_TEST` flag. *Scissoring* can be disabled by calling :code:`gl.disable()`.
If you are rendering multiple scenes into a canvas, you only need to enable
*scissoring* once in your pre-processing code. Here are example calls:

.. Code-Block:: JavaScript

  // Turn on the scissor test
  gl.enable(gl.SCISSOR_TEST);

  // Turn off the scissor test
  gl.disable(gl.SCISSOR_TEST);

.. figure:: figures/viewport.png
  :alt: Image Coordinate System
  :align: right

  Scissoring Parameters

To specify the sub-area of the *render buffer* that you want to render into,
you use the same parameters as a viewport, as in this example call:

.. Code-Block:: JavaScript

  // set the scissor rectangle
  gl.scissor(xOffset, yOffset, width, height);

Distinct Scissor Areas
----------------------

Please experiment with the following WebGL program which renders four scenes
into a single canvas. This is a typical layout for some modeling tools which shows
a *top*, *front*, and *side* view of a model, along with a perspective view.

.. webglinteractive:: W1
  :htmlprogram: _static/09_scissoring1/scissoring1.html
  :editlist: _static/09_scissoring1/scissoring1_scene.js
  :hideoutput:
  :width: 300
  :height: 300

As you experiment with the example WebGL program above, please verify that
you understand the following ideas:

* *Scissoring* is typically enabled once in your pre-processing code. (See line 233.)
  In complex rendering scenarios, *scissoring* can be enabled and disabled during
  the rendering process.
* *Scissoring* determines which part of the rendering buffer is modified,
  while the *viewport* command determines where and how big the rendering is mapped
  to the canvas. The *scissor* parameters and the *viewport* parameters do not
  have to be the same. However, since *scissoring* prevents changes to the
  *render buffer* anywhere outside its defined limits, any portion of the
  *viewport* that is outside the *scissor* sub-area will not be rendered.
* Rendering into a *scissored* sub-area requires that you set the aspect
  ratio of your *projection* to be the same aspect ratio as the sub-area.
  If the aspect ratios are different, the rendering will be distorted. Notice
  that the projection matrix is redefined for each
  rendering to match the aspect ratio of the scissored sub-area. Try replacing
  line 147 with :code:`matrix.createPerspective(45.0, 1.0, 1.0, 30);` and
  see what happens.

Scissor Overlays
----------------

Below is another WebGL program you can experiment with. A scene is rendered into
the overall canvas and then scissoring is used to render a different scene
into a sub-area of the canvas. If you click and drag inside the sub-area you
can move the location of the sub-area -- similar to how many video phone apps
function, such as FaceTime.

.. webglinteractive:: W2
  :htmlprogram: _static/09_scissoring2/scissoring2.html
  :editlist: _static/09_scissoring2/scissoring2_scene.js, _static/09_scissoring2/scissoring2_events.js
  :hideoutput:
  :width: 300
  :height: 300


As you experiment with the example WebGL program above, please verify that
you understand the following ideas:

* The initial rendering is done using the entire canvas (i.e., the entire *render buffer*).
* The second rendering is done on a *scissored* subarea starting at line 153.
* The colors in the *render buffer* and the depth values in the *depth buffer*
  must be cleared to ensure that the first rendering does not affect the
  second rendering. (See lines 109 and 157.) The flags to the :code:`gl.clear()`
  function are *bit flags*, so make sure you use the *bitwise or* operator, :code:`|`,
  and not the *logical or* operator, :code:`||`.
* Using a different clear color for the two renderings makes it clear where
  the *scissored* subareas are located.
* The code that allows you to drag the smaller subarea is in the *mouse drag*
  event handler, :code:`self.mouse_dragged`, in the :code:`Scissoring2Events` class
  object. The current code allows a user to drag the subarea outside the canvas.
  This could be prevented with appropriate :code:`if statements` in the
  event handler function.

Glossary

.. glossary::

  Scissoring
    Restrict the graphics pipeline to only allow modification of a rectangular
    subarea of pixels in a *render buffer*. A rendering is mapped into this
    subarea as if it was the entire canvas. *Scissoring* must be enabled before
    it can be used.
