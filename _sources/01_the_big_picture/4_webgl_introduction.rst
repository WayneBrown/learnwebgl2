1.4 - Introduction to WebGL
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::

What is WebGL?
--------------

Why learn WebGL? Very simply, it is the only cross-platform solution
for producing real-time, 3D computer graphics we have.

.. admonition:: What about Direct3D?

  **Direct3D** is a proprietary graphics system made by Microsoft. Using
  Direct3D restricts the execution of your graphics to Microsoft based devices.

.. admonition:: What about OpenGL?

  **OpenGL** is cross-platform and executes on Windows, Lunix, MacOS, etc.,
  but OpenGL does not have a
  definitive way to interface to an operating system's user interface. There
  is a code library that makes OpenGL cross-platform development possible
  called `GLUT`_ (or `FreeGlut`_), but GLUT does not include the standard
  user interface elements (e.g., buttons, slider bars, input boxes, etc.)
  that most graphics applications tend to use.

WebGL is a JavaScript API (application programmer interface) that allows
a programmer to use the graphics processing unit (GPU) of a computing device
in a web browser window to render real-time 3D computer graphics. Basically
WebGL is a software driver that gives you a single interface to all
commonly used GPU's. When you update hardware, such as purchase a new phone,
your WebGL applications still work because the WebGL driver knows how
to communicate with the new hardware. Given that hardware is outdated
in only a few years, and that you don't want to rewrite your graphics
applications that often, using WebGL is a great win for software development.

WebGL is a subset of OpenGL. WebGL executes in all modern web browsers,
including web browsers on tablets and phones. Therefore, when you learn WebGL,
you are learning OpenGL for an environment that basically will execute on
all modern computing devices. That is really cool!!!

What is a WebGL Program?
------------------------

A typical web page that contains 3D computer graphics generated by a WebGL
program is made up of these basic components:

*   A HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) description of the web page which contains
    one or more *canvas* elements to render the 3D graphics.
*   A CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) that describes how elements of the HTML document are formatted.
*   A HTML *canvas element* in the web page that provides a rectangular area in which 3D computer graphics can be rendered.
*   Graphical data that defines the 3D objects to be rendered, along with
    descriptions of the lights in the scene and the camera that defines the current view.
*   JavaScript programs that:

    * loads your graphics data (such as model descriptions),
    * configures your graphical data,
    * renders your graphical data, and
    * responds to user events.

*   WebGL Shader programs that perform critical parts of the graphical rendering.

All of these basic components initially reside on a web server. When a user
(a client) requests a web page that contains 3D graphics, the data
described above has to be transferred to the client's computer, stored
in correct places, and then processed by appropriate processors.

When a client requests a web page from a web server, the following
sequence of events happen:

#. The server sends the HTML description of the web page to the client
   and the client stores the web page in RAM.
#. The client's web browser (e.g., Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
   reads the HTML page description and requests any other documents that
   are referenced in the HTML code, including JavaScript code,
   CSS (cascading style sheets), images, data files, etc. All of these
   files are downloaded and stored in the client's RAM.
#. If there is JavaScript code associated with the page, it is
   executed. For a page that contains 3D graphics, the JavaScript code
   performs the following tasks:

   + It might request that other data files be downloaded from the server
     (for example, the data that describes the 3D graphic objects to be
     rendered).
   + It retrieves and initializes the WebGL *graphics context* associated
     with the HTML canvas element where the graphics will be rendered.
   + It configures and copies any model data to the GPU's memory.
     (Technically the data is copied to GPU *vertex object buffers*).
   + It establishes "event handlers" that associate HTML events with
     JavaScript code. The code is executed when an event happens.

#. Finally, the web page is rendered to a window in the browser and
   the web page waits for user events. Timer events can be set up to
   automatically generate events on a regular schedule, which can create
   animations of the 3D graphics.

To re-emphasize the "big picture," the diagram below summarizes the
above discussion. Note that the JavaScript code runs on the CPU(s) and
the graphics rendering is done by the GPU(s). The JavaScript code is
the "master". It "runs the show" and tells the GPU(s) when and what to
render. The GPU(s) execute the graphics pipeline and make real-time graphics
possible because of their speed of rendering.

  Where the different parts of a WebGL program are stored and executed

When a JavaScript event handler initiates the rendering of graphics into a HTML canvas
element, it tells the GPU which object buffer(s) contain the data it
wants to render and then issues the WebGL "draw" command. In a
typical graphics program, the model data is copied to the GPU's memory
only once. The rendering is efficient and fast because the data is local
to the GPU. If the transfer of data between RAM and the GPU's memory
is minimized, real-time graphics is possible in the browser.

A basic principle of all computer graphics is that expensive operations
should only be done once. Throughout this textbook you will continually
see the phrases "pre-processing step" and "rendering step". The goal is
to perform the "pre-processing step", which is done by the CPU, only once.
This allows the actual rendering that is done by the GPU to be as fast
as possible.

All of the JavaScript code in this textbook that performs graphics
rendering is divided into two separate parts:

#. a setup (or pre-processing) part that is done once, and
#. a rendering part that is performed each time an object is drawn.

Each lesson will make a clear distinction between pre-processing code
and rendering code.

Tutorial Examples
-----------------

A web page interface that allows you to view WebGL code, data, and the results of
a WebGL rendering has been developed for this textbook and an example
is shown below. The interface allows you to experiment with a WebGL program
interactively. Remember, personal experimentation is critical to your
learning! Pause when you come to the interactive examples and experiment!

The interface includes commands across the top of the WebGL example that
allow for the following options:

*   **Re-start** - If you edit the code displayed in the left window panes, you
    can click the "Re-start" button to update the WebGL program using your modified
    code and/or data. If you introduce errors in the WebGL program
    it will not execute properly. If this is the case, you should see
    error messages displayed in the output window pane below the canvas. In some
    cases, the errors will only be visible in the JavaScript console window.
    If you can't resolve the errors that you introduced into the program, you can
    always start over by re-loading the entire web page.
    If text in an editor pane is highlighted with a light gray background, the
    text is "readonly" and can't be modified. In the demo below you can edit the
    definition of the cone model, but only view the HTML code.
*   **Show checkboxes** - Allows you to hide any of the three display panels in
    the WebGL interactive example.
    You will find it helpful to hide the canvas while you are studying and editing
    the editor panes.
*   **Download Files** - Downloads all of the files that make up this WebGL
    program to your computer's default download folder. These are the original files
    that created the WebGL program. The number of files
    can be large, depending on the complexity of the example. It is recommended that you empty
    your download folder before downloading a WebGL program so you don't
    miss any important files. To use the code files
    in a stand-alone program the files will have to be organized appropriately
    in sub-folders. (More on this later.)
*   **Download Edited Files** - Downloads a copy of the files you have edited
    in the editor panels. The downloaded copy will have any changes you have
    made to the text.

The interactive example below is shown here for you to familiarize yourself
with the interface. All of the edit windows are *read-only* for this example.
Simply examine the HTML, JavaScript, and model data to see what they look like.
You can interact with the graphics in this specific example by clicking and dragging your
mouse in the canvas window. You can also enable or disable the automatic
animation using the checkbox below the canvas window. If you would like
to see the results of the WebGL program as a separate, independent page, use
the hyperlink at the bottom of the interactive example. Depending on your
default browser settings, the WebGL program will open in a new window or
a new tab.

.. webglinteractive:: W1
  :htmlprogram: _static/01_example02/example.html
  :editlist: _static/models/model_cone4.obj
  :viewlist: _static/01_example02/example.html
  :width: 300
  :height: 300


Download the files for the example above and then look in you computer's
download folder at the files that were created. This will help you understand
what is required for a WebGL program.
