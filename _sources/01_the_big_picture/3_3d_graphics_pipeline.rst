1.3 - The 3D Graphics Pipeline
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**3D computer graphics** takes a *vector graphics* representation of objects
and creates a 2D raster image. But how? It is a non-trivial process that
requires multiple steps involving almost every major component of a computing
device. Let's first review the major components of a computing device and
then see how they are used to create computer graphic images.

Computational Device Hardware
-----------------------------

*Computer graphics* is created by modern computing devices
such as desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and cell phones.
These devices are complex systems with many components. All devices
that produce visual output to a screen will have the following types
of processing units.

1.  `CPU's`_ (central processing units) are the "brains" of a device.
    CPU's perform the general processing and run the operating system
    (OS) which controls the overall functioning of the device.
2.  `GPU's`_ (graphics processing units) are specially designed to render 3D
    graphics. However, in recent years they have also been used for other applications,
    such as speech recognition and neural network training. Any processing
    that requires large amounts of identical simultaneous computations can
    potentially be accelerated using a GPU.

Modern computing devices also contain many types of memory, each designed for
specific purposes.

1.  **RAM** (random access memory) stores program data and program instructions.
2.  **Graphics memory** stores vector data, raster images, and a screen's pixels.
    This memory has special properties that facilitates 3D graphics.

Here is a simplified diagram that shows the relationship between these components.

To create computer graphics imagery, all of these hardware components are used
extensively.

Rendering using a "Graphics Pipeline"
-------------------------------------

The process of converting vector graphic representations of objects into a
raster image is performed by a well defined, step-by-step process called the
*graphics pipeline*. In the early days of computer graphics the *pipeline*
was not programmable. Data was fed into the pipeline and out came a raster
image on the other side. But today's GPU's allow for a programmer
to control certain parts of the pipeline using *shader programs*.
A *shader program* is a specialized set of instructions for
manipulating graphics data in the graphics pipeline.
*Shader programs* provide a programmer with amazing flexibility and
potential creativity, but at the cost of added complexity.

  The Graphics Pipeline

Step 1 in the pipeline is data setup. A webGL program must establish a link
between the *attribute* variables in a *vertex shader* program and the GPU
buffers that hold the data those variables use. Any other
data that the *shaders* need for a model rendering is also copied to the *shader
program*. These are called *uniform* variables because they don't change as
a single rendering is performed.

Step 2 is execution of a *vertex shader* program on each vertex of a
geometric primitive defined in model *world coordinates*.
Each vertex is transformed into *normalized device coordinates*.
This is typically done with a single
matrix transformation matrix, which is a combination
of transformations that move a model to the correct place in a scene,
then positions the model in front of a virtual camera, and then projects
the *world coordinates* into a *unit cube*.

Step 3 *clips* away all of the data that is outside the field-of-view of
the virtual camera.

Step 4 maps the model data from *normalized device coordinates* into
a viewport defined in pixels.

Step 5 *rasterizes* a geometric primitive by determining which
pixels in the raster image are inside it's boundaries.

Step 6 executes a *fragment shader* on each pixel that composes a
geometric primitive and outputs a color value for the pixel.

Step 7 combines (*composites*) the color of a pixel from a
*fragment shader* with the color of the pixel already assigned
to the output *draw buffer*.

Note that step 1 is performed by the CPU from instructions specified
in JavaScript code, while the remainder of the pipeline is performed
by the GPU from shader program instructions defined in GLSL
(OpenGL Shading Language). Step 1 uses data from RAM to setup a model
render, while the GPU uses its own memory for the rest of the steps.
Explaining the details of each of these *pipeline* steps is the purpose
of this textbook.
